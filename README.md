# Leaf-Disease-Analysis-using-

-Transformed raw data in the form of images to NumPy array to comply with the Machine Learning algorithm. 
-Involved in developing advanced graphic visualization concepts to map and simplify the analysis of numeric data using preprocessing techniques to extract reports for further analysis. 
-Implemented and evaluated Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Neural Network using TensorFlow and VGG19. 
-Developed a prototype of Machine Learning model with 90.1% accuracy which helped in identifying different types of leaf diseases.
